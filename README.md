Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The purpose of the homework was to create a responsive design that ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 

First, I created a responsive nav bar that remains consistant across each page, checking to ensure that each link worked.

Next, I created mobile responsive pages using Bootstrap's components and grid systems, checking their responsiveness on a variety of window sizes.

I also used CSS styling to create a background image with a low opacity to serve as a backdrop for my elements and to create a unified look to my pages.
